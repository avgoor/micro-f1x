Micro-f1x
=========

This is an example of "bare-metal" programming for the STM32F103C8x series w/o
using huge STM32 Libraries like HAL/LL. In the includes are only the essential
parts: an ld-script, a startup assembly code and headers with CMSIS and
F103-specific H/W registers. The goal is mostly to learn low-level STM32
programming and to use pure C++ as much as it's only possible.
